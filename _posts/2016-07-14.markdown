Learie Constantine (1901â€“1971) was a West Indian cricketer, lawyer and politician who played 18 Test matches before the Second World War. Although his Test record was modest, he helped to establish a uniquely West Indian style of aggressive play. He served as Trinidad's High Commissioner to the United Kingdom and in 1969 became the UK's first black peer. His early experiences of race discrimination affected him profoundly, and in later life he was influential in the passing of the 1965 Race Relations Act in Britain. Born in Trinidad, Constantine toured England with the West Indies cricket teams in 1923 and 1928 before signing as a professional with the Lancashire League club Nelson. He played for the club between 1929 and 1938, while continuing to appear in Test cricket for the West Indies; he lived mainly in England for the rest of his life. After qualifying as a barrister in 1954, Constantine returned to Trinidad, entered politics and served in the Trinidad government as minister of communications. In 1961 he was appointed Trinidad's High Commissioner in the UK, serving until 1964 and remaining in London thereafter. In his final years, he served on the Race Relations Board, the Sports Council and the Board of Governors of the BBC.
